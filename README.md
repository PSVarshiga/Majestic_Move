## Feature 
    Chess Engine: Implement a chess engine that enforces the rules of chess, validates moves, and checks for   checkmate and stalemate.

    Move History: Provide a move history feature that allows players to review the sequence of moves in a game.

## Rules
  Basic Piece Movement:
    King: The king can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. However, it cannot move to a square that is under attack.
    Queen: The queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.
    Rook: The rook moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
    Bishop: The bishop moves diagonally any number of squares.
    Knight: The knight moves in an L-shape, consisting of two squares in one direction followed by one square perpendicular to that. Knights can jump over other pieces.
    Pawn: Pawns move forward one square but capture diagonally. On their first move, pawns have the option to move forward two squares. When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king).

  Check and Checkmate:
    Check: When a player's king is under direct attack by an opponent's piece, it is in check. The player must make a move to get the king out of check.
    Checkmate: If a player's king is in check and cannot make a legal move to escape the threat, it is checkmate, and that player loses the game.

  Stalemate and Draws:
    Stalemate: If a player has no legal moves to make and their king is not in check, the game results in a draw due to stalemate.
    Draws: Chess games can also end in draws due to insufficient material (e.g., king vs. king, king and bishop vs. king and bishop with the bishops on opposite colors), threefold repetition, or the fifty-move rule (no pawn movement or capture in the last fifty moves).
